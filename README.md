# HWU Timetable
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/AdamTMalek/HWUTimetable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/AdamTMalek/HWUTimetable)

HWU Timetable or in full Heriot Watt University Timetable is an unofficial Android application that makes it much easier to 
view student timetables on a mobile device.

## What is it and why it exists?
The student timetable website is not mobile friendly. The aim of this project is to not only change that, 
but also provide some of the functionalities that will make student's life at the University easier.

The app allows you to add a timetable to "followed", this saves it locally on your device so you can view it
at any time and place you want without having to be connected to the Internet. 

(*The following is not yet implemented*) The word choice of "followed" is deliberate. The app will check the 
website regularly to see if there are any updates to the timetables and if there are it automatically updates the stored
timetable and sends you a notification.
## Current state of the project
The app, at this stage, is still far from being ready to be deployed.

Currently, the main focus goes on implementing the core functionality rather than User Experience. At the current state
the app may go through many major changes from one update to another without giving any notice, therefore it is strongly
recommended that (assuming you are interested) you stay patient until the app will be considered ready to be deployed.

Functionalities that have been implemented so far are:
- Adding timetable to have it locally stored
- Viewing the parsed timetable in a very simple form
